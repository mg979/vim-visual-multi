INTRODUCTION                                        *visual-multi-introduction*
===============================================================================

Visual-Multi (VM in short) is a multiple selections/cursors plugin.

Rather than imitating other multiple cursors implementations, as they can be
seen in other editors, it tries to be faithful to Vim's modal editing, and take
advantage from it.

Somebody questions the usefulness of such a plugin in Vim, since Vim has
features that can make up for it, namely: powerful macros, visual block, |gn|
text object, |:global| command and more.

Still I think that multiple selections cover a middle ground for which macros
and other methods are a bit cumbersome, or you just want some visual feedback
on what you're doing.

I think of them as an evolution of visual block, so if you think visual block
has its usefulness and its place in Vim, why should it be different for
multiple selections?





MODES                                                      *visual-multi-modes*
===============================================================================

There are two main modes VM can work in, |cursor-mode| and |extend-mode|.
They roughly correspond to |normal-mode| and |visual-mode|.

At any time you can switch between them with the <Tab> key.


-------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-cursor-mode*

In |cursor-mode| commands expect a motion, so if you type `c`, it will have to
be followed by the text object you want to change. Supported commands:

    operators   see |vm-operators|
    motions     see |vm-motions|
    |           set column for all cursors (to current column or [count])
    r           replace single character
    R           enter |vm-replace-mode|
    ~           change case of single character
    &           repeat last substitution
    <C-A>       increase number
    <C-X>       decrease number

Also see |vm-motions| for supported motions in VM (some with differences).


-------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-extend-mode*

In |extend-mode|, it's like having multiple visual selections: motions will
extend them, and change/yank/delete commands won't wait for a motion, just like
in visual mode. Even the key |o| works as in visual mode, inverting the anchor
of the selections.

Some commands are specific to |extend-mode|, such as:

    S       |vim-surround| is required
    R       replace pattern in regions
    \\s     split regions by pattern

Some commands enforce |cursor-mode| when run from |extend-mode|, such as:

    <C-A>   increase number
    <C-X>   decrease number

Others can use a different mapping:

    gu/gU   change case (instead of vim default u/U)

More specific commands will be covered further on.


-----------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-motions*

Most basic vim motions (including |%|) are supported in VM. They behave
differently from other commands because their result is dependent on the mode:
in `cursor mode` they will move cursors, in `extend mode` they extend
selections.

Also keep in mind that all motions are restricted by default to the current
line, that is, they cannot cross line boundaries unless |multiline-mode| is
enabled.

Finally, some |object-motions| and |various-motions| require |multiline-mode|,
and some are aliased to avoid conflict with VM mappings `[` and `]`:

   vim    VM~
    (     (       [count] sentences backward
    )     )       [count] sentences forward
    {     {       [count] paragraphs backward
    }     }       [count] paragraphs forward
    [(    g(      go to [count] previous unmatched '('
    [{    g{      go to [count] previous unmatched '{'
    ])    g)      go to [count] next unmatched ')'
    ]}    g}      go to [count] next unmatched '}'


---------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-operators*

VM supports several operators by default:

  y/d/c       yank/delete/change
  gu/gU       change case

There is also built-in support for:

    |vim-surround|      example: `ysiw(` to enclose in parentheses
    |vim-abolish|       example: `cr_` to change current word to snake case

Other operators can be used, but you have to define them.
See |g:VM_user_operators|.


-------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-insert-mode*

You'll probably want to enter insert mode in VM. There are several things you
should be aware of:

* don't expect snippets, or complex interactions with other plugins, to work
* autocomplete, abbreviations and <C-R> work normally
* <C-W> works, but by default is limited to the current line
* <C-U> works normally (for all cursors)
* <CR> will respect indentation, but not comments
* code autoreindentation is disabled

Some settings are temporarily disabled to prevent trouble:

    'indentkeys', 'cinkeys', 'softtabstop', 'textwidth'

Some keys have a special behaviour (different from vim):

    <C-^>   go to start of line (at indent level)
    <C-F>   one character forward
    <C-B>   one character backward
    <C-D>   same as <Del>
    <C-V>   can paste the contents of VM unnamed register

NOTE: Some mappings that you may have (<C-H> for <BS> etc.) will NOT work,
and they will probably break your text. For some of them there may be
solutions, for others not. See |vm-remap|.

NOTE: Since <C-V> is remapped, you should use <C-Q> to insert special
characters.

NOTE: insert mode related options:
  |g:VM_insert_special_keys|
  |g:VM_use_first_cursor_in_line|


------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-replace-mode*

|Replace-mode| is partially implemented in VM. It can be started in two ways:

- from cursor mode, by pressing |R|.
- from insert mode, by pressing <Insert> (toggle).

The main limitation is that only one region per line is allowed, so if you have
more regions in the same line, they will be collapsed first.

<BS> only works inside the same lines.
Keys other than <Left> and <Right> don't work.


-------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-visual-mode*

VM works entirely from normal/insert mode, so the name can be misleading. But
this means that you can still use visual mode and VM has a set of mappings to
work with it. You can among other things:

- add words and patterns, select all occurrences of visual selection
- subtract visual selection from VM regions
- conversely, remove all regions that are not in the visual selection
- find regex pattern in visual selection, etc

See |vm-visual-mappings| for details.


----------------------------------------------------------  *vm-multiline-mode*

Maybe you noticed, in other editors with multiple cursors, how hard it is to
actually control them. What are they good for, if then you have so little
control over them?

In VM, not only you have much finer control through motions, but, in both
modes, cursors and selections are 'kept in line', that is, cursors cannot end
up in a different line, and selections similarly.

You may still want to do so, at times. You'll have to enable |multiline-mode|,
for which the default mapping is `M`.

Note that multiline mode must be enabled for some text objects motions, or they
will fail. See |vm-motions|.


---------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-registers*

VM uses its own registers, that are lists of strings, one element for each
region that is yanked/deleted. You can read more about them in the
|visual-multi-registers| section, since this is an accessory topic.





REGIONS AND PATTERNS                                      *visual-multi-regions*
===============================================================================

With the term 'region' I mean either a cursor or a selection. You can consider
the cursor as a region with 0 width.

Each region has (usually) an underlying pattern. When you select a word, you
add a pattern. When you select something with regex, you also add a pattern,
and they'll all be searched when you look for the next occurrence.
You may add as many patterns as you wish.

Sometimes regions are created without a pattern: for example when you add
single cursors, or create a column of cursors, or when you start selecting with
<Shift> + arrow keys.

In all these cases, the pattern will be automatically added when possible, that
is, when you are in extend mode and look for the next occurrence. A pattern
will never be automatically added in cursor mode.





MAPPINGS                                                *visual-multi-mappings*
===============================================================================

What follows are the default mappings, and an overview of most commands.
For a quick reference of the mappings, and instructions on how to change them,
see |g:VM_maps| or:
>
    :help vm-mappings.txt
<
VM mostly uses buffer mappings, except a handful of them that are always
mapped. Buffer mappings are applied when VM starts, and removed when VM ends.
It tries not to overwrite pre-existant buffer mappings, so rather than doing
that, it warns you that a mapping could not be applied. This isn't true for
insert mode mappings, that will overwrite existant buffer mappings. You'll
still be warned if this happens.


----------------------------------------------------------------  *g:VM_leader*


Since there are a lot of new mappings, the chance for conflicts would be high,
if you use plugins that use buffer mappings (common with |ftplugins|).
VM uses its own leader to reduce this chance.
Default is `\\` (two backslashes). If you want to change it, set (for example):
>
    let g:VM_leader = '\'
<
When you see mappings with 2 backslashes, that's the VM leader, so the mappings
will be different if you change it.

Transposition                \\t                          |vm-transpose|

NOTE: some mappings in this list are <buffer> mappings, that is, they are
available only after VM has started.

NOTE: you don't need to learn all, or even most commands. If you think you'll
use the plugin for quick refactorings, and you want to keep things simple, you
can stop reading here, and just use some of the commands listed in this table.

---------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-find-word*
Find Word ~

  Default mapping: <C-n>

  Selects the word under cursor. Can be run from normal mode (with word
  boundaries, similarly as |*| would) or visual mode (without word boundaries).

  From normal mode it accepts a [count], so that you can do 3<C-n> to select
  the first 3 occurrences of the word under cursor.

  After VM has started, you can also use the following mappings:
                                                                 *vm-find-next*
    n            find next
    N            find previous
    q            skip and find next (or previous if searching backwards)
    ]            go to next
    [            go to previous
    <C-f>        go to next (by page)
    <C-b>        go to previous (by page)

  NOTE: <C-n> behaves both as `find next` if pressed on an existing region, or
  `find word` otherwise, adding a new pattern.

  NOTE: when you change direction of search, skipping a region will respect the
  new direction.

  NOTE: you can press <C-n> also in cursor mode: all words under cursors will
  be selected, but in this case no patterns will be added. A new pattern is
  only added when you press <C-n> on some text without any region.

  NOTE: you can remap these keys. See also |vm-remap|.


-------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-add-cursors*
Add Cursors Down/Up ~

  Default mapping: <C-Down> / <C-Up>

  Used to create vertical columns of cursors. A cursor is only added if not
  present in that position. Pressing the keys once will create two cursors, one
  at the current position, one in the line above/below.
  [count] increases this number. See also |g:VM_skip_shorter_lines|.


--------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-add-cursor*
Add Cursor at Position ~

  Default mapping: \\\

  Creates a single cursor at the current position. If there is a cursor
  already, the cursor is removed.


------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-shift-select*
Select Right/Left ~

  Default mapping: <S-Right>, <S-Left>

  If VM didn't start yet, it will start selecting left or right, otherwise it
  will extend all regions. It always forces |extend-mode|.

  After VM started, if you want to add a new region rather than extending
  existing ones, you can press <M-Right> and <M-Left> (they won't work in all
  vim versions).

  NOTE: these commands don't create or add new patterns. This is convenient if,
  for example, you start selecting a part of a word with <Shift> + arrows, then
  press `find next` (<C-n> or ]): a pattern will be automatically added.


--------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-select-all*
Select All Words ~

  Default mapping: \\A

  Selects all occurrences of a word. Works in both normal and visual mode.
  Rules are the same as for <C-n>. Works from visual mode too.


------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-regex-search*
Find with Regex ~

  Default mapping: \\/

  Enter a regex pattern as by / command. A selection will be created with that
  pattern. Pressing `n/N` will then find the next occurrence of that pattern,
  rather than the word under cursor.

  If started from visual mode, it will select all occurrences of that pattern
  in the visual selection.


---------------------------------------------------------  *vm-toggle-mappings*
Toggle Mappings ~

  Default mapping: \\<Space>

Disable all <buffer> VM mappings, so that you can (for example) use regular
motions to move somewhere else in the file, without affecting regions at all.

<Esc> key is still mapped (to exit VM), as it is this function itself (to
re-enable VM mappings).


---------------------------------------------------------  *vm-select-operator*
Select Operator ~

  Default mapping: s

  Only after VM has started. It acts on all regions, reshaping the selections
  on the given text object. Example: `si[` would select inside brackets.


-----------------------------------------------------------  *vm-find-operator*
Find Operator ~

  Default mapping: m

  Only after VM has started. 'm' as 'matches in text object': it finds the
  current patterns in the given text object, creating selections.
  Example: `mip` would find all patterns in the current paragraph.


----------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-infoline*
Show Infoline ~

  Default mapping: \\l

  The 'infoline' shows information about current regions and patterns and the
  modes you're in. If the statusline works this will be redundant, but in case
  it doesn't this can be of help. The symbols used between both are the same.

RUN ... AT CURSORS                                *visual-multi-run-at-cursors*
===============================================================================

You can enter any kind of normal/visual/ex command, and it will be repeated at
each cursor. For example, to swap lines with regions with the lines below them:
>
  \\z   normal ddp
<
With the dot command you can repeat:

- the last edit done outside of VM (also edits done in |replace-mode|)
- operations at cursors (`daw`, `ciw`, etc)
- the last VM normal command (`x`, `X`, `~`, etc)
- the last VM normal command as entered with `\\z`

COMMANDS                                                *visual-multi-commands*
===============================================================================

The commands that follow are placed somewhat in order of complexity (and
arguably usefulness), so if you think as you go on reading, that something is
'just too much', you can skip the rest.

Quick reference ~

Alignment                     \\a, \\<, \\>              |vm-align|
Replace in regions            R                          |vm-replace-pattern|
Subtract from regions         \\s                        |vm-subtract-pattern|

Numbering                     \\n, \\N                   |vm-numbering|
Filter regions                \\f                        |vm-filter|
Transform with expression     \\e                        |vm-transform|



--------------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-align*
Alignment ~

  Default mappings: \\a, \\<, \\>

  Alings all regions, by setting their minimum column to the highest of all.
  If run from |extend-mode|, selections will be collapsed to cursors first, but
  it will work anyway.

  There are three variants for this command:

  \\a   aligns by setting the minimum column to the highest of all regions
  \\<   aligns by character, or [count] characters
  \\>   aligns by regex pattern


---------------------------------------------------------  *vm-replace-pattern*
Replace pattern in regions ~

  Default mapping: R

  You'll be asked for a pattern to replace, then for its replacement, and the
  substitution will take place in all selected regions, leaving unselected text
  untouched.

  Only working in |extend-mode|. When |R| is pressed in |cursor-mode|, it will
  start |vm-replace-mode| instead.


--------------------------------------------------------  *vm-subtract-pattern*
Subtract pattern from regions ~

  Default mapping: \\s

  The entered pattern will be subtracted from regions, splitting them.
  Only working in |extend-mode|.


---------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-transpose*
Transposition ~

  Default mapping: \\t

  Swaps the contents of selections, cycling them if there are more than two.
  If there is an equal number of selections in each line, swapping takes place
  within the same line only.

  Only working in |extend-mode|.


---------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-duplicate*
Duplication ~

  Default mapping: \\d

  Duplicates in place the contents of the selections, reselecting the original
  ones. Only working in |extend-mode|.


----------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-shifting*
Shift Selections ~

  Default mapping: <M-S-Right>, <M-S-Left>

  Move the selections right or left, preserving the surroundings.


---------------------------------------------------------  *vm-case-conversion*
Case conversion ~

  Default mapping: \\C

  Menu for case conversion. If called when in cursor mode, it will be run on
  inner words, and some methods won't work (eg. space case -> snake case).

  Letters in the prompt have the following meaning:

    u          lowercase
    U          UPPERCASE
    C          Captialize
    t          Title Case
    c          camelCase
    P          PascalCase
    s          snake_case
    S          SNAKE_UPPERCASE
    -          dash-case
    .          dot.case
    <space>    space case

  It reuses functions extracted from |vim-abolish|.


----------------------------------------------------------  *vm-remove-every-n*
Remove every n regions ~

  Default mapping: \\R

  Removes every `n` regions. Without [count] it will remove every other region,
  with [count] 3 it will remove every third region, etc.


--------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-goto-regex*
Go-to-regex motion ~

  Default mappings: \\g, \\G

  It is similar to a |f| motion (find character), but it accepts a regex
  pattern and a [count]. \\G does the same, but additionally it will remove
  regions for which the motion failed (the character[s] could not be found).

  Examples:  >
    \\g   ->  a     ->  will search for the letter 'a' in the same line
    \\g   ->  \d    ->  will search for a digit
    \\G   ->  \d    ->  will also remove cursors where a digit was not found
    2\\g  ->  \d\d  ->  will search for 2 consecutive digits


---------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-numbering*
Numbering ~

  Default mapping: `\\n`, `\\N`

  Appends or prepends numbers with an expression. Accepts [count].
  Expression syntax is: >
    start=[count]/step/separator

<  For example, started with `\\N`: >
    2/2/,<space>
<  will generate:  >
    2, text
    4, text
    ...
<  If started with `\\n`, the result will be instead: >
    text, 2
    text, 4
    ...
<

------------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-filter*
Filter regions ~

  Default mapping: \\f

  Filter (out) regions based on pattern or expression. After running this
  command, regions that don't conform to your query will be removed.

  By pressing <C-x>, you can cycle filtering method:  >

  pattern:    remove regions that don't match the pattern
  !pattern:   remove regions that match the pattern
  expression: remove regions that don't match the expression (same as below)


---------------------------------------------------------------  *vm-transform*
Transform regions with expression ~

  Default mapping: \\e

  You can enter a vim expression, that will be run on each region.
  You can use some placeholders:  >
     %t     region's text
     %i 	  region's index
     %n	    total number of regions
<
  Regions text will be rewritten as  >
    new region's text = your expression
<
  Examples: >
    %t * 3                   will multiply all regions' text by 3
    %t." ".%i." / ".%n 	     will append index / total to the region's text
    %i%2 ? %t : toupper(%t)	 will make uppercase all odd regions (1,3,5...)
    %i%3-2 ? %t : ''	       will delete every third region
<
  Only working in |extend-mode|.





NOTES ABOUT REGISTERS                                  *visual-multi-registers*
===============================================================================

VM uses its own registers: they don't have a 'type' as vim registers, because
they are lists of strings (the regions contents). Still, some conversion
between vim and VM (and viceversa) takes place.

When yanking regions:~

  A copy of the regions contents are saved in a VM register. If no register is
  specified, only the unnamed register is written. The unnamed `vim` register
  is also overwritten, and it will be of type |blockwise-register|. This means
  that after you exit VM, you'll find any yanked text in the unnamed register.

When deleting regions:~

  As above, but the text is also copied in the VM '-' register (in analogy with
  vim's small delete register |quote-|).

When changing regions:~

  The text is stored in the VM '-' register, but the unnamed register is not
  overwritten, unless a register is specified. Likewise, `vim` unnamed register
  is not overwritten.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What happens when you paste some text in VM depends on whether a VM register
(from a previous operation in VM) is available or not.

When pasting from VM registers:~

  Regions are pasted as they were yanked/deleted, for example if you type `dw`,
  then move with `w` and paste with `p`, the regions that you deleted will be
  pasted back. If the number of regions is different, VM will paste as many as
  it can.

When pasting from vim registers:~

  |characterwise-register|  the same content is pasted in all regions

  |linewise-register|       similarly, but a linewise paste is performed
                          (the only case this can happen in VM!)

  |blockwise-register|      it is treated as if it were a VM register
                          (each line of the block goes into one region)


Note: when exiting VM, its registers are not deleted. Only the unnamed and '-'
registers are always cleared. To show VM registers, type |:VMRegisters|.
You can also enable persistance (see |g:VM_persistent_registers|).




OTHER FEATURES                                             *visual-multi-other*
===============================================================================

Smart case change~
                                                         *vm-smart-case-change*

In |extend-mode|, if a change command is started with `gc` rather than `c`,
text will be "smartcased", that is:

* at main cursor, text is always inserted as typed
* at other cursors, if region text was fully uppercased, replacement will be
  uppercased as well
* if the region text was capitalized, the replacement will be as well


Undo/Redo ~
                                                                 *vm-undo-redo*
This feature is still experimental. It allows to undo edits done inside VM, and
restore the selections or the cursor positions to the state prior to the undone
change. It will not allow you to undo changes that were made before entering VM
(you need to exit VM first).

To enable it (see |g:VM_maps|):
>
    let g:VM_maps["Undo"] = 'u'
    let g:VM_maps["Redo"] = '<C-r>'
<

Reselect last set of regions ~
                                                             *vm-reselect-last*
  Default mapping: \\gS

This command works similarly as |gv|, in that it tries to reselect the regions
as they were before exiting VM last time. Note that it works by byte offset, so
if you did any change after exiting VM, the reselected regions will be wrong.

Note that inside a VM session, this command reselects the last set of regions
in extend mode, i.e. before switching to cursor mode, and the default mapping
is gS (without leader).




SINGLE REGION MODE                                   *visual-multi-single-mode*
===============================================================================

  Default mapping: \\<CR>

It is a submode that allows motions to be performed on single regions, rather
than all at once. Commands still affect all regions, though.

                                   |vm-buffer-mappings| |g:VM_single_mode_maps|

When you enter insert mode you can use <Tab> and <S-Tab> to cycle among
cursors, to make changes sequentially at each of them. When you press <Tab>,
you are brought to the next cursor, and the way (`i`, `a`, `I`, `A`) insert
mode was started in still applies.
                                                  |g:VM_single_mode_auto_reset|

By default, this mode is deactivated by default when exiting insert mode, but
only if <Tab> key has been used at least once, i.e, it won't happen if you move
from region to region and perform individual changes, without cycling cursors
from within insert mode.
