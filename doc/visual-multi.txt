REQUIREMENTS                                        *visual-multi-requirements*
===============================================================================

Vim 8/Neovim is required.






INTRODUCTION                                        *visual-multi-introduction*
===============================================================================

Visual-Multi (VM in short) is a multiple selections/cursors plugin.

Rather than imitating other multiple cursors implementations, as they can be
seen in other editors, it tries to be faithful to Vim's modal editing, and take
advantage from it.

Somebody questions the usefulness of such a plugin in Vim, since Vim has
features that can make up for it, namely: powerful macros, visual block, |gn|
text object, |:global| command and more.

Still I think that multiple selections cover a middle ground for which macros
are a bit cumbersome, visual block is unsufficient, |gn| is limited in what it
can do, and you don't always want to make a global change on the whole file.

I think of them as an evolution of visual block, so if you think visual block
has its usefulness and its place in Vim, why should it be different for
multiple selections?





MODES                                                      *visual-multi-modes*
===============================================================================

There are two main modes VM can work in, |cursor-mode| and |extend-mode|.
They roughly correspond to |normal-mode| and |visual-mode|.

At any time you can switch between them with the <Tab> key.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               *vm-cursor-mode*

In |cursor-mode| commands expect a motion, so if you type `c`, it will have to
be followed by the text object you want to change. Supported commands:

    c/y/d   change/yank/delete (+ text object)
    |       set column for all cursors (to current column or [count])
    r       replace single character
    ~       change case of single character
    w/b/%   and all other basic motions
    <C-A>   increase number
    <C-X>   decrease number

There is built-in support for:

    |vim-surround|      example: `ysiw(` to enclose in parentheses
    |vim-abolish|       example: `cr_` to change current word to snake case

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               *vm-extend-mode*

In |extend-mode|, it's like having multiple visual selections: motions will
extend them, and change/yank/delete commands won't wait for a motion, just like
in visual mode. Even the key |o| works as in visual mode, inverting the anchor
of the selections.

Some commands are specific to |extend-mode|, such as:

    S       |vim-surround| is required
    R       replace pattern in regions
    \\s     split regions by pattern

And more, commands will be covered further on.

Another feature of |extend-mode| is |smart-case-change|, started with `gc`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            *vm-multiline-mode*

One thing that always bothered me in other editors with multiple cursors, is
how hard it is to actually control them. What are they good for, if one wrong
move can scramble them irreparably?

In VM, not only you have much finer control through motions, but, in both
modes, cursors and selections are 'kept in line', that is, cursors cannot end
up in a different line, and selections similarly.

You may still want to do so, at times. You'll have to enable |multiline-mode|,
for which the default mapping is `\\M`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               *vm-insert-mode*

You'll probably want to enter insert mode in VM. There are several things you
should be aware of:

* don't expect snippets, or complex interactions with other plugins, to work
* autocomplete, abbreviations and <C-R> work normally
* <C-W> works, but by default is limited to the current line
* <C-U> works normally (for all cursors)
* <CR> will respect indentation, but not comments
* code autoreindentation is disabled

Some settings are temporarily disabled to prevent trouble:

    'indentkeys', 'cinkeys', 'softtabstop', 'textwidth'

Some keys have a special behaviour:

    <C-A>   go to start of line
    <C-E>   go to end of line
    <C-F>   one character forward
    <C-B>   one character backward
    <C-D>   same as <Del>
    <C-V>   can paste the contents of VM unnamed register

NOTE: Some mappings that you may have (<C-H> for <BS> etc.) will NOT work,
and they will probably break your text. For some of them there may be
solutions, for others not. See |visual-multi-customization|.

NOTE: Since <C-V> is remapped, you should use <C-Q> to insert special
characters.






REGIONS AND PATTERNS                                      *visual-multi-regions*
===============================================================================

With the term 'region' I mean either a cursor or a selection. You can consider
the cursor as a region with 0 width.

Each region has (usually) an underlying pattern. When you select a word, you
add a pattern. When you select something with regex, you also add a pattern,
and they'll all be searched when you look for the next occurrence.
You may add as many patterns as you wish.

Sometimes regions are created without a pattern: for example when you add
single cursors, or create a column of cursors, or when you start selecting with
<Shift> + arrow keys.

In all these cases, the pattern will be automatically added when possible, that
is, when you are in extend mode and look for the next occurrence. A pattern
will never be automatically added in cursor mode.





MAPPINGS                                                *visual-multi-mappings*
===============================================================================

What follows are the default mappings, and an overview of most commands.
For a quick reference of the mappings, and instructions on how to change them,
see |g:VM_maps| or:
>
    :help vm-mappings.txt
<
VM mostly uses buffer mappings, except a handful of them that are always
mapped. Buffer mappings are applied when VM starts, and removed when VM ends.
It tries not to overwrite pre-existant buffer mappings, so rather than doing
that, it warns you that a mapping could not be applied. This isn't true for
insert mode mappings, that will overwrite existant buffer mappings. You'll
still be warned if this happens.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  *g:VM_Leader*

Since there are a lot of new mappings, the chance for conflicts would be high,
if you use plugins. VM uses its own leader to reduce this chance.
Default is `\\` (two backslashes). If you want to change it, set (for example):
>
    let g:VM_Leader = '\'
<
When you see mappings with 2 backslashes, that's the VM leader, so the mappings
will be different if you change it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Find Word ~
                                                                 *vm-find-word*
  Default mapping: <C-n>

  Selects the word under cursor. Can be run from normal mode (with word
  boundaries, similarly as |*| would) or visual mode (without word boundaries).

  From normal mode it accepts a [count], so that you can do 3<C-n> to select
  the first 3 occurrences of the word under cursor.

  After VM has started, you can also use the following mappings:

    ]        find next
    [        find previous
    }        go to next
    {        go to previous
    <C-f>    go to next (by page)
    <C-b>    go to previous (by page)
    q        skip and find next (or previous if searching backwards)

  NOTE: <C-n> behaves both as `find next` if pressed on an existing region, or
  `find word` otherwise, adding a new pattern.

  NOTE: when you change direction of search with [, skipping a region will
  keep searching backwards.

  NOTE: you can press <C-n> also in cursor mode: all words under cursors will
  be selected, but in this case no patterns will be added. A new pattern is
  only added when you press <C-n> on some text without any region.

  NOTE: you can remap these keys, e.g.:
>
    let g:VM_custom_remaps = {'<c-p>': '[', '<c-s>': 'q'}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add Cursors Down/Up ~
                                                               *vm-add-cursors*
  Default mapping: <C-Down> / <C-Up>

  Used to create vertical columns of cursors. A cursor is only added if not
  present in that position. Pressing the keys once will create two cursors, one
  at the current position, one in the line above/below.
  [count] increases this number.
                                                      *g:VM_skip_shorter_lines*
  By default shorter lines are skipped when adding cursors. To change:
>
    let g:VM_skip_shorter_lines = 0
<
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add Cursor at Position ~
                                                                *vm-add-cursor*
  Default mapping: \\\

  Creates a single cursor at the current position. If there is a cursor
  already, the cursor is removed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Select Right/Left ~
                                                              *vm-shift-select*
  Default mapping: <S-Right>, <S-Left>

  If VM didn't start yet, it will start selecting left or right, otherwise it
  will extend all regions. It always forces |extend-mode|.

  After VM started, if you want to add a new region rather than extending
  existing ones, you can press <M-Right> and <M-Left> (they won't work in all
  vim versions).

  NOTE: these commands don't create or add new patterns. This is convenient if,
  for example, you start selecting a part of a word with <Shift> + arrows, then
  press `find next` (<C-n> or ]): a pattern will be automatically added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Select All Words ~

  Default mapping: \\A                                          *vm-select-all*

  Selects all occurrences of a word. Works in both normal and visual mode.
  Rules are the same as for <C-n>.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Find with Regex ~
                                                              *vm-regex-search*
  Default mapping: \\/

  Enter a regex pattern as by / command. A selection will be created with that
  pattern. Pressing <C-n> (or ], etc) will then find the next occurrence of
  that pattern, rather than the word under cursor.

  If started from visual mode, it will select all occurrences of that pattern
  in the visual selection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Get Operator ~

  Default mapping: \\gs                                       *vm-get-operator*

  Creates a new selection from a text object. It can also create a pattern, but
  only if there are no patterns yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Select Operator ~
                                                           *vm-select-operator*
  Default mapping: s

  Only after VM has started. It acts on all regions, reshaping the selections
  on the given text object. Example: `si[` would select inside brackets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Find Operator ~

  Default mapping: m                                         *vm-find-operator*

  Only after VM has started. 'm' as 'matches in text object': it finds the
  current patterns in the given text object, creating selections.
  Example: `mip` would find all patterns in the current paragraph.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Single Region Mode ~
                                                               *vm-single-mode*
  Default mapping: \\<CR>

  In this mode, motions will affect a single region, rather than all at once.
  Commands still affect all regions, though.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Block Mode ~

  Default mapping: \\<BS>                                       *vm-block-mode*

  The |block-mode| is a minor mode that works inside the |extend-mode|. It can
  help keeping the same width when adding new regions vertically with <C-Down>
  or <C-Up>, but there isn't much else about it right now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Show Infoline ~
                                                                  *vm-infoline*
  Default mapping: \\l

  The 'infoline' show informations about current regions and patterns, and the
  modes you're in.  >
    M+ / m- : whether mappings are enabled or not
    V+ / v- : whether multiline is enabled or not
    B+ / b- : whether block mode is enabled or not
    O+ / o- : whether single region mode is enabled or not
<
  After that: >
    [n] : index of currently selected region
    number of regions/cursors
    current patterns





RUN ... AT CURSORS                                      *visual-run-at-cursors*
===============================================================================

This kind of commands is certainly alien to any other multiple cursor system,
but they can be very powerful.

For example, to swap lines with regions with the lines below them: >
  \\z   Normal command?   ddp

The |dot| is also good because it can repeat edits done in Vim |replace-mode|,
a thing that is impossible otherwise (VM doesn't currently support replace mode
in insert mode).

NOTE: the dot command can repeat the last edit done outside VM, but once you
start editing things inside VM, don't expect the same! It can repeat deletions
at cursors (`dw` kind of things) but not more.

Quick reference ~

===============================================================================

The commands that follow are placed somewhat in order of complexity (and
arguably usefulness), so if you think as you go on reading, that something is
'just too much', you can skim over the rest.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alignment ~
                                                                      *vm-align*
  Default mappings: \\a, \\<, \\>

  Alings all regions, by setting their minimum column to the highest of all.
  If run from |extend-mode|, selections will be collapsed to cursors first, but
  it will work anyway.

  There are three variants for this command:

  \\a   aligns by setting the minimum column to the highest of all regions
  \\<   aligns by character, or [count] characters
  \\>   aligns by regex pattern

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Replace pattern in regions ~
                                                           *vm-replace-pattern*
  Default mapping: R

  You'll be asked for a pattern to replace, then for its replacement, and the
  substitution will take place in all selected regions, leaving unselected text
  untouched.

  Only working in |extend-mode|.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subtract pattern from regions ~
                                                          *vm-subtract-pattern*
  Default mapping: \\s

  The entered pattern will be subtracted from regions, splitting them.
  Only working in |extend-mode|.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transposition ~
                                                                 *vm-transpose*
  Default mapping: \\t

  Swaps the contents of selections, cycling them if there are more than two.
  If there is an equal number of selections in each line, swapping takes place
  within the same line only.

  Only working in |extend-mode|.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Duplication ~
                                                                 *vm-duplicate*
  Default mapping: \\d

  Duplicates in place the contents of the selections, reselecting the original
  ones. Only working in |extend-mode|.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shift Selections ~
                                                                  *vm-shifting*
  Default mapping: <M-S-Right>, <M-S-Left>

  Move the selections right or left, preserving the surroundings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Case conversion ~
                                                           *vm-case-conversion*
  Default mapping: \\C

  Menu for case conversion. If called when in cursor mode, it will be run on
  inner words, and some methods won't work (eg. space case -> snake case).

  It reuses functions extracted from |vim-abolish|.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remove every n regions ~
                                                            *vm-remove-every-n*
  Default mapping: \\R

  Removes every `n` regions. Without [count] it will remove every other region,
  with [count] 3 it will remove every third region, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go-to-regex motion ~
                                                                *vm-goto-regex*
  Default mappings: \\g, \\G

  It is similar to a |f| motion (find character), but it accepts a regex
  pattern and a [count]. \\G does the same, but additionally it will remove
  regions for which the motion failed (the character[s] could not be found).

  Examples:  >
    \\g   ->  a     ->  will search for the letter 'a' in the same line
    \\g   ->  \d    ->  will search for a digit
    \\G   ->  \d    ->  will also remove cursors where a digit was not found
    2\\g  ->  \d\d  ->  will search for 2 consecutive digits

Numbering ~
                                                                 *vm-numbering*
  Default mapping: \\n, \\N

  Prepends or appends numbers with an expression. Accepts [count].
  Expression syntax is: >
    start=[count]/step/separator
<  For example: >
    2/2/,<space>
<  will generate:  >
    2, text
    4, text
    ...
<  If started with \\N, the result will be instead: >
    text, 2
    text, 4
    ...
<

Filter regions ~
                                                                    *vm-filter*
  Default mapping: \\f

  Filter (out) regions based on pattern or expression. After running this
  command, regions that don't conform to your query will be removed.

  By pressing <C-x>, you can cycle filtering method:  >

  pattern:    remove regions that don't match the pattern
  !pattern:   remove regions that match the pattern
  expression: remove regions that don't match the expression (same as below)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transform regions with expression ~
                                                                 *vm-transform*
  Default mapping: \\e

  You can enter a vim expression, that will be run on each region.
  You can use some placeholders:  >
     %t     region's text
     %i 	  region's index
     %n	    total number of regions
<
  Regions text will be rewritten as  >
    new region's text = your expression
<
  Examples: >
    %t * 3                   will multiply all regions' text by 3
    %t." ".%i." / ".%n 	     will append index / total to the region's text
    %i%2 ? %t : toupper(%t)	 will make uppercase all odd regions (1,3,5...)
    %i%3-2 ? %t : ''	       will delete every third region
<
  Only working in |extend-mode|.





OTHER FEATURES                                             *visual-multi-other*
===============================================================================

Smart case change~
                                                         *vm-smart-case-change*

In |extend-mode|, if a change command is started with `gc` rather than `c`,
text will be "smartcased", that is:

* at main cursor, text is always inserted as typed
* at other cursors, if region text was fully uppercased, replacement will be
  uppercased as well
* if the region text was capitalized, the replacement will be as well


Undo/Redo ~
                                                                 *vm-undo-redo*
This feature is still experimental. It allows to undo edits done inside VM, and
restore the selections or the cursor positions to the state prior to the undone
change. It will not allow you to undo changes that were made before entering VM
(you need to exit VM first).

To enable it (see |g:VM_maps|):
>
    let g:VM_maps["Undo"] = 'u'
    let g:VM_maps["Redo"] = '<C-r>'
